# Print Analysis

After each print, you can get AI-powered suggestions to improve your settings. The AI looks at your print data and tells you what to adjust.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get a Free API Key

The easiest option is **GitHub Models** (free):

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Adaptive Flow"
4. Don't check any boxes - no permissions needed
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_`)

### Step 2: Add Your Key

Edit the file `analysis_config.cfg` in your Klipper-Adaptive-Flow folder:

```ini
[analysis]
provider: github
api_key: ghp_paste_your_token_here
```

### Step 3: Run Analysis

After a print completes:

```bash
cd ~/Klipper-Adaptive-Flow
python3 analyze_print.py
```

That's it! You'll see suggestions like:

```
💡 SUGGESTIONS
┌─────────────────┬─────────┬───────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ Parameter       │ Current │ Suggested │ Reason                   │
├─────────────────┼─────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ speed_boost_k   │ 0.08    │ 0.10      │ Better heat at high speed│
└─────────────────┴─────────┴───────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

## Alternative: Use Ollama (100% Local, No Internet)

If you prefer to run AI locally on your own computer:

### Step 1: Install Ollama

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Step 2: Download a Model

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

This downloads about 4GB - only needed once.

### Step 3: Configure

Edit `analysis_config.cfg`:

```ini
[analysis]
provider: ollama
```

No API key needed!

**Running Ollama on another computer?** Add the URL:

```ini
[analysis]
provider: ollama
ollama_url: http://192.168.1.100:11434
```

## Auto-Analyze Every Print

Want analysis to run automatically after each print? Set it up as a background service.

### Step 1: Make Sure Your Config is Set

Edit `analysis_config.cfg` with your provider and API key (see above).

### Step 2: Create the Service

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/adaptive-flow-hook.service
```

Paste this (change `pi` to your username if different):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Adaptive Flow Print Analyzer
After=moonraker.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/Klipper-Adaptive-Flow
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/Klipper-Adaptive-Flow/moonraker_hook.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save with Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X.

### Step 3: Start It

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable adaptive-flow-hook
sudo systemctl start adaptive-flow-hook
```

Now every print will be analyzed automatically!

### Check If It's Running

```bash
sudo systemctl status adaptive-flow-hook
```

## What Does the AI Analyze?

The AI looks at data from your print:

- **Temperature**: Did the heater keep up? Was it working too hard?
- **Flow Rate**: How much plastic was being pushed through
- **Print Speed**: How fast the toolhead was moving
- **Any Errors**: Problems in the Klipper log

Based on this, it suggests changes to make your prints better.

---

## Understanding the Suggestions

The AI might suggest changing values in your config. Here's what they mean:

| Setting | What It Does | When to Increase |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| `flow_k` | Adds heat when pushing more plastic | Heater can't keep up during infill |
| `speed_boost_k` | Adds heat at high speeds | Underextrusion on fast moves |
| `ramp_rate_rise` | How fast temp goes up | Slow response to speed changes |
| `max_boost` | Maximum extra temperature | Need more heat headroom |

**Don't worry about memorizing these** - the AI explains why it's suggesting each change.

## Configuration Options

All settings are in `analysis_config.cfg`:

```ini
[analysis]
# Which AI service to use
provider: github

# Your API key
api_key: ghp_your_token

# Automatically apply safe suggestions (optional)
auto_apply: false

# Show results in Klipper console
notify_console: true
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No logs found"

The analysis needs print data. Make sure you've completed at least one print with Adaptive Flow enabled.

Check if logs exist:
```bash
ls ~/printer_data/logs/adaptive_flow/
```

### "API key error" or "Unauthorized"

Your API key might be wrong. Double-check:
1. No extra spaces in `analysis_config.cfg`
2. Token hasn't expired (GitHub tokens can expire)
3. Token was copied completely

### Ollama not working

Make sure Ollama is running:
```bash
ollama list
```

If it shows models, it's working. If not:
```bash
ollama serve
```

### Need More Help?

Open an issue on GitHub with:
1. The error message you see
2. Which provider you're using
3. Your `analysis_config.cfg` (remove your API key first!)
